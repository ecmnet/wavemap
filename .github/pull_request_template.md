For performance or accuracy-related changes, include the above system and runtime information and describe:

- **Performance (optional)**
    - Measured operation: [e.g. serializing the map, performing 1M queries, processing dataset X]
    - Metrics [e.g., CPU time, wall time, total RAM usage]
- **Accuracy (optional)**
    - Metrics: [e.g., AUC, accuracy, recall]
- **Summary of changes**
    - What metrics improved and by how much?
    - Did any metrics worsen?

### Benchmarks (To be completed by maintainers)

We will rerun wavemap's benchmarks and report the results here to validate there are no general performance/accuracy regressions.
